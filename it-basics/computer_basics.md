# Computer Basics – Codecademy

## Overview
This lesson covers the fundamentals of computer systems, including hardware, software, and how they interact.  
Understanding these basics is essential for IT support and cybersecurity, since vulnerabilities often arise from misconfigured systems or outdated software.

## Key Concepts
 **Hardware Components**
  - CPU (processor), RAM (memory), storage (HDD/SSD), buses, motherboard, ports
    -- CPU: Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), Registers (Immediate Access Store)
  - Input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer)
- **Software**
  - System software (operating systems)
  - Application software (word processors, browsers)
  - Bases (Bit, Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal) 


## Examples
- Storage: Primary vs. Secondary Memory - Typing and not saving a Word document vs. uploading 150 photos to the computer
- Output: Using a mouse to open a file, output is the file's content
- Binary: Combination of 0s and 1s. 100110 is the binary equivalent of the number 38.
- Hex: 0x A 9 F C = 0b 1010 1001 1111 1100 - every four binary digits become a single hexadecimal expressed in base 16
 
## Takeaways
- Processing is comprised of the translation of input and the instructions given for output.
- Data to our hardware is a series of binary, on and off, electrical pulses.
- Storage consists of non-volatile(retains info) and volatile memory(doesn't not retain info)
- Converting binary to decimal value and decimal to binary
- Both CPUs and GPUs have similar measures for computation performance. Made up of cores that can do one operation at a time and determine how often they can perform.
- Throughput is used to measure the amount of data transferred over time, while latency is the measure of delay before a transfer begins.
