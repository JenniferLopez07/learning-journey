# Networks and The Internet – Codecademy

## Overview
This lesson introduces the core concepts behind computer networks and how devices communicate across local and global systems.
Understanding networking is essential for IT support and cybersecurity, as misconfigurations, insecure protocols, and poor network design often lead to vulnerabilities.

## Key Concepts
 **Hardware Components**
 - Modem – Connects a home or business network to the ISP.
 - Wireless Router – Distributes network access to devices.
 - Coaxial Cable / Ethernet Cable – Physical media used to transmit data.
   
 **Software & Communication**
  - Browsers – Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome.
  - Servers – Systems that store, process, and deliver data.
  - Client–Server Model – Client requests → server responds.
  - HTTP Requests & Status Codes – Communication between browser and server.
  - HTML & CSS – Core technologies for rendering web pages.
  - IP Addresses & MAC Addresses – Unique identifiers for devices.

  **Network Types**
  - LAN – Local Area Network
  - CAN – Campus Area Network
  - WAN – Wide Area Network
  - VPN – Virtual Private Network (secure tunneling)

  **Network Models**
  - OSI Model (7 Layers)
    1. Physical
    2. Data Link
    3. Network
    4. Transport
    5. Session
    6. Presentation
    7. Application
  - TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
    1. Application
    2. Transport
    3. Internet
    4. Network Access (Link Layer)
       
   **Network Protocols**
   - DNS – Converts domain names to IP addresses.
   - HTTP/HTTPS – Web communication protocols.
   - Email Protocols – POP3, IMAP, SMTP.
   - SSH – Secure remote access.
   - SMB – File and printer sharing.
   - FTP – File transfer protocol.


## Examples
- Client-Server Flow
  Browser --> sends request --> Web Server
  Web Server --> sends response --> Browser
- Status Code Example: 404 Not Found - Resource does not exist.
- OSI Model Example: Data travels from Physical --> Application layers as it moves across a network
   
## Takeaways
- Client–Server Communication
  - A client is the device or application requesting data (e.g., browser).
  - A server waits for incoming requests and responds with data.
  - Communication happens using HTTP, and servers return status codes to indicate success or errors.
    
- Networking Fundamentals
  - Wireless networks require proper configuration of routers, modems, and security settings.
  - IP addresses uniquely identify devices on a network.
  - Different network types (LAN, WAN, VPN) serve different purposes.

- OSI & TCP/IP Models
  - OSI provides a conceptual framework for understanding how data moves.
  - TCP/IP is the practical model used on the internet.
  - Each layer has a specific role in transmitting, routing, and presenting data.

- Protocols & Services
  - DNS translates human-readable domains into IP addresses.
  - Ports act like “traffic lanes” for different services (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).
  - SSH, SMB, FTP enable secure access, file sharing, and data transfer.
  - POP3 downloads email from a remote server to a single device.
    
- Troubleshooting
  - Understanding how networks function helps diagnose connectivity issues, misconfigurations, and protocol failures.
