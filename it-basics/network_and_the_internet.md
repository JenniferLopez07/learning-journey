# Networks and The Internet – Codecademy

## Overview
This lesson covers the fundamentals of computer systems, including hardware, software, and how they interact.  
Understanding these basics is essential for IT support and cybersecurity, since vulnerabilities often arise from misconfigured systems or outdated software.

## Key Concepts
 **Hardware**
 - Modem, Wireless Router, Coaxial Cable, Ethernet Cable
   
 **Software**
  - Browsers (safari, internet explorer, firefox)
  - Servers
  - Client-Server Model
  - HTTP Requests and Status Codes
  - HTML files and CSS stylesheet
  - IP Address and Mac Addresses

  **Network**
  - LAN, CAN, WAN, VPN
  - OSI: Network Model
  - TCP/IP Model
  - Network Protocols (DNS, HTTP, Email)


## Examples
- Browser and Server functionality: browser ---> client request ---> web server // web server ---> server response ---> browser
- Status Code: 404 Error
- OSI: Network Model -- Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
   
## Takeaways
- In a client-server model, the client refers to the user's device or program that is making a request for data. The client can be a browser or an application running
- A server is the device or program in a network that waits for incoming requests and sends back data
- Understanding the relationship and functionality between a browser and server.
- Browser and server communicate with one another using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- Server responds to client via status codes as a part of their response
- Setting up a Wireless Network
- IP addresses identify a device on a network
- Different types of networks and their functions
- 7 layers of the OSI: Network Model
  - Physical: Raw data bits are received as a stream of 0s and 1s. Covers how unstructured data, like bits, is transmitted
  - Data Link: How data is sent from device to device when connected to the same local network
  - Network: How data packets are routed between wider networks
  - Transport: Data is actually transferred
  - Session: When two computers have started an exchange of information
  - Presentation: Methods to convert data into a format usable by an application
  - Application: Includes websites, browsers, email, mobile applications, and how they render internet data
- TCP/IP Model
  - Application: Includes the opening and closing of sessions, translating data, and the interaction with content at the application level
  - Transport: TCP and UDP are the core protocols. Acknowledgement of the sender and receiver and transmitting data quickly
  - Internet: Where the IP addressing and routing occur
  - Network Access: Also known as the Link Layer, encompasses the sending or receiving of network data at the local network level
- Converting domain names to IP[ addresses is part of the DNS (Domain Name System) protocol
